# Fully functional website - HTML, CSS, SCSS, Javascript
 I developed a fully functional website for Biscayne Park using HTML, CSS, SCSS, and JavaScript. This dynamic and responsive site features an intuitive user interface, showcasing the park's amenities, events, and attractions. With modern design elements and smooth navigation, visitors can easily access information, view galleries, and stay updated on park activities. The website effectively enhances user engagement and promotes the vibrant community of Biscayne Park.
